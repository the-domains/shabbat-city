may this work be guided

by whomever you call to your side,

your allies,

your teachers,

and the

endless streams

of people you have given

yourself to

from the deep heart connection

of friends you continuously fully arrive for

and the people passing through

like that person at the party

with terrible social anxiety

and you sitting beside them

asking their name

looking right in their eye

you

a safe harbor

****

in a sea of personal storms.
